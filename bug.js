This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with specific camera configurations.  The error message might not be clear, but it essentially prevents the camera from rendering properly or functioning correctly. This often happens when certain props are not set correctly or when there's a mismatch between the requested capabilities and the device's actual capabilities. For example, attempting to request a very high resolution that is beyond the device's capabilities might cause this. This might lead to unexpected behavior, blank screen, or crashes.
